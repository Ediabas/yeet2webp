    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. 100% Client-Side Processing (Zero Server Storage)</h2>
    <p>Yeet2WebP takes your privacy extremely seriously. Our image conversion tool operates entirely within your web browser (client-side) using HTML5 and Canvas APIs. <strong>We do not upload, transmit, or store any of your images on external servers.</strong> Your files never leave your device.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Because the core functionality of Yeet2WebP runs locally on your machine, we do not require user accounts, email addresses, or any personal identification to use the service.</p>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Third-Party Advertising</h2>
    <p>We use third-party advertising companies (such as Google AdSense) to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>

    <h2>4. Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>We may use minimal tracking tools like Google Analytics to understand overall website traffic and user demographics (e.g., visitor counts, browser types). This data is anonymized and strictly used to improve website performance.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
